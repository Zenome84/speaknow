I don't think that you can judge a person based on just one meeting. I think that you have to see a person in a multitude of various contexts in order to see what they're like in different situations before you can really get a whole picture of the person. Just as an example, I could think of people that I work with who maybe seem a bit standoffish or reserved, but that's just their office persona. You meet them outside of work in a more social setting and you see them more comfortable and come alive and in fact find out that the person that you thought was a bit rude, dismissive or condescending is actually quite warm, affectionate and affable once you get them in the right context. So it's really not a great idea to judge someone based on the first impression that you get of them."

And it's really an essential part that they, you know, they live with themselves so live with themselves so that they can know what they are and they can take further life decisions for themselves.

But if some friend like to ask you for money, borrow your money or asking you to go for a walk, spend a lot of money on gambling or drinking beers, it's not good.

So it's good to have a good friend. Thank you so much."
./data/1692748253740912-1.mp3," I think we should try to narrow the gap between the have and the have not because this is to reduce the inequality in the society. Like if, for example, let's say we have a big gap between the rich and the poor and let's say the rich will just become richer and richer whereas the poor will become poorer and poorer. So the poor might see it as a very unfair society that they are currently living in. So of course in order to become transparent about that, we should try to narrow the gap and then maybe the society could create employment, especially for the unemployed or those who are poor, like try to provide them a job instead of let them be unemployed. And the government needs to make sure that there is a very stable political society. Probably like there is no unrest, political unrest in the country that they are living in. For example in Myanmar, there's always a fight between the government and their citizens. So it seems like it's not ideal. So yeah."

I think there should not be set to the particular stereotypes toward the genders. So I think that woman can be excelled at her, I mean her experts rather than her husbands and she can make more money than her partner. So it's not, I mean, important to consider whether he or she is a woman or a man. It's more crucial to consider the individual's perspectives or individual's competencies toward their work and toward their role in the family. And I can see different kinds of changes are occurring in my country too. So women do not hesitate or reluctant to go outside to do their works. And sometimes we can see on the television or on the Instagram or YouTube channels, like women who is highly appreciated in her company.

I believe that the second option is better because personally I think that you cannot grow to your full potential when you are in one place. You need to explore. You need to see different traditions and be around different people in order to truly know what you want to do in life. Let me give some instances. For example, I am a student who's been studying in a certain area, but then I'm doing my bachelor's. So if I would want to do my master's, I would want to go to another city or another country so that I can see how the education is there and accordingly decide what I want to do for my future. And I would also want to go to a place where I would have more employment opportunities.

So I personally believe that the second option is better because staying at one place, yes you may feel comfortable with the place you could settle but at the same time you never really explore the whole world. You never get to experience new things in your life. When you move to different places, when you move across the world, you learn a lot more about that place which helps you develop as a person. And staying in one place, yes it may be know being in your own comfort zone but again going outside your comfort zone should also be priority of people."

For example, when I teach young children aged 6 or 7, I learn many new tips and techniques in teaching them, and how to manage the class so on and so forth while I was teaching and while I teach the adult or young people age around 12 to 16 I learned another type of techniques that I could use to teach them and it's really best to meet those people I mean the students because I can learn from them I can have fun with them whenever I am in the class that's really good and"

They can do it at their own will. They do a lot of work. They do a lot of hours. They can make more money if they are busy with their study. They just turn off the app so you don't have to go online. It's not really difficult. It depends, but mostly it's more about the safety during the work. The difficulty is not much because just carrying stuff in just one way to make money with the commission that the company gives. But the thing is safety because delivery people, they have to drive very fast and sometimes have to cut the traffic in order to make sure that the food reaches the customers' chill or if it's something hot, they have to reheat hot and some customers probably, if they order the food hot and it arrives cold, they probably reject the food and that they lose the money.

Basically this job is one of my favorite jobs in the first child since I was influenced by my grandma. She's also, she was a teacher since she was in the middle of her age. The job is pretty good to me. I think I'm good at it since during my studies at the university, I normally like to share things regarding to lessons, some difficulty regarding to our lessons from different subjects. Whenever I taught them, I felt like I was happy during that time because I'm happy to see people, they knowing something else that they have no idea what is it about and I think it is good. I like this job, as I mentioned, I like to see people happy when they know something new, when they misunderstand about something and I just explain them and they just realize that all it is just like this easy or that's it. So yeah, that's the reason I like to be a teacher. Moreover, I think knowledge is not easily passed on from one person to another. So I think for the person who has the ability, the innate ability in the way that transfer the knowledge from one person to another, it is the great way. So I would find myself in that way.

I mentioned salary, obviously, because you need remuneration for any job and the remuneration needs to be commensurate with the lifestyle that you want to lead. I would say that passion is important because it's really hard to continue with a job that you don't care about or that doesn't really appeal to you. And then I would mention location as well. I mentioned it last not because it's least important, but being able to access your job site conveniently and quickly actually, I think, improves a worker's overall job satisfaction.

The benefits of doing this is that you can focus much more on the education solely, so that you have more time to read and explore in depth and also analyze in a more detailed way. But at the same time, there can be some disadvantages because probably you've got to spend more time on doing all the assignments and other related research and probably you don't have time to do it all.

So how can they balance between their personal life and work? They need to know how to balance their time. To me, I believe that after working, I can chat with my friends through social media so that I can keep in touch with them. So I will maintain all my friends. They will not go away from me, even though we are all so busy with our work. We still can keep in touch.

For example, first of all, they would submit their CV and we have to take a look at their background of the CV. And after that, we also need to analyze their personality test as well. So I believe that they are quite useful because sometimes people could just simply put anything in the CV or their cover letter and then in the personality test, maybe they will have to read some scenario and decide which one is the best that fits them. So the result could actually give us a big picture of their personality. And then after their personality test, maybe the next step, I think it's for them to do the group interview. So I also believe that they are kind of somewhat useful because This is like to challenge like most of the time they only do individual interview and Putting them in group would mean that they have to challenge another and try to bring out or to say what is the best for them. And then after the group interview, I think another screening method is for them to sit the test. For example, let's say they are applying for an accounting position. So of course, maybe they have to sit on a test and do the accounting stuff and see what it turns out, whether or not they know about the accounting that they are applying for."

A team player who understands that gossiping and workplaces crossing each other's boundaries is wrong and one who strives to be disciplined while at the same time being understanding of the other person is a kind of a person that I would like to work with.

For example, you can have a sense of harmony and you can have a sense of oneness by co-working and having friendship with your close colleagues in your workplace. And also you can know how to communicate with others who have different kinds of personalities, characteristics other than yourself. But there are certainly have drawbacks too. For instance, if you encounter bumping into someone who don't fit with your personality, for example, if someone is too introvert and reluctant to communicate with others actively, then she might feel very stressful and sometimes freaked out, be freaked out in the middle of the conversations with other colleagues.

She has been doing her own work independently and she did not interrupt my project also. She respected me. She treated me with a very respectful way.

However, some jobs are just not satisfying to some people. Hence, the person who wants to get out there to explore their own choices and capabilities and opportunities outside of the job area, it makes them resign from their current job in order to gain that independence to seek out new opportunities outside. Yes, in my country, people often change their jobs for the same very same reason. Some people just want to explore more opportunities. They want to give time to their passion. They want to do something that they love instead of cursing out their jobs, nine to five jobs every single day. A company can make a person stay by recruiting them according to their passions and qualities and also providing the person enough peace and stability for their mental health just as they do for physical health. If a person is mentally happy and satisfied, he can sustain more physically than if the mental health is worsened. Hence, I believe if a company takes steps to even preserve a person's mental health side by side to his physical health, it can help make employees stay and give another try to the company."

The advantages of this can be like a better society for people but only if they're motivated to do it. Usually when people give an extra work they don't like to do it. They do it hastily and badly so it would be worse than not having them do it at all.
./data/1692748253740131-3.mp3," No, in my opinion, I do not think that there is any sort of moral duty for a professional athlete to be an upstanding citizen or role model for anyone. While I do think that it would be ideal for a professional athlete to inspire people to have better standards or to behave like better citizens, that's not really part of their job. Asking a professional athlete to always be law-abiding, upstanding, and some sort of bastion of civilization isn't really commensurate with the job that they've been hired to do, which is physical exertion. So an athlete shouldn't have that role any more than say a teacher should be responsible for following traffic laws precisely. It's just it's not what they're hired to do. While they can inspire, while they can be role models, while they can advocate for good causes, that is great, but that is not part of their job description. So I do not find that it would be part of their obligation."

There are also good and bad things in one way. For the bad thing, it's kind of overcrowded. For example, in the weekends, people used to go on vacations or going to take rest around the road or go to the riverside so it kind of overcrowded. People sometimes it's kind of traffic jams at night because people they used to drunk and they just drunk while driving so it's cause a traffic accidents easily. For the best cities in my country is the capital cities of Cambodia is Phnom Penh which is the popular place and full of people, full of workshop, full of companies so it's kind of easier and convenient to find a job. And also it's the best place for tourism like there are many kinds of places to visit. People used to go to Phnom Penh when they stayed in the countryside.

And it will definitely help elderly people to use computer for you for you know, maybe contacting relatives or people who live far, far away from them. And I would definitely would like to work as an instructor in such a club because I love elderly people and they're really naive and they're really sweet and I think that if we have the expertise and knowledge, so we should always help them."

So, mostly I ask my wife to use Google Maps to find the way to any places that we want to go to. Because there are a lot of temples to visit, so we look at the Google Maps to find the place. And it allows us to get to the direction that we want to. Normally I went to Angkor temple and then we go to have lunch and move on to Bajon temple and other temples but because we cannot find easily so we don't usually go to many temples. Mostly we go to Angkor temple and Bajon temple. And walking in the Angkor temple, it's easy to get lost because it's so big and the architecture and let's say the structure inside the temple is so complicated if you walk alone you might get lost I mean I already experienced that I normally when I go I walk in groups so that we will not get lost if anyone get lost it's hard to find each other it's hard to find him or her because the temple is so big thank you so much"
./data/1692748253740912-3.mp3," International media is very important to every country. Maybe first of all let us talk about the advantages first. So international media allows people to see what is happening outside their own country. Like local media is good but international media could just open people's eyes to the outside world, could expose them to what is happening in terms of political, in terms of social, in terms of technology use. See what the world is like, and this could help people to be open-minded to accept the new changes. But it also could have the disadvantages because somehow we are exposed to something that is not very useful or something that is harmful to our society. Maybe somehow we adopt the wrong idea because maybe different countries have different situations so somehow what we see from the other countries could not be applicable to what we could do in our own country. To me, I follow a lot of media from the other country, especially the country with democracy, for example, like South Korea, the United States, because my country is quite communist and I want to learn about democracy and freedom from the other countries here."

And of course there are people, as we live in a society it's our duty to keep our streets clean. So we try to keep it clean. We try to not throw garbage here and there. We try to keep it in a separate place so that we throw it when a person comes to take it away to dump it to some other place that's supposed to be dumped. To keep the streets clean, first of all, we should not throw away the things which we are carrying. Like if we're eating something after we are done eating, we not throw it on the streets we should search a place which has a dustbin to throw it away. If we do this then our streets will be very much clean and it will be very hygienic it will not spread diseases that's it."

CCTV has been such a great aid to the police and to the crime department. However, I do believe there should be a limit to where CCTVs are placed. Public places are 100% okay to have CCTV cameras. However, I think private places such as inside of a restaurant or a private lounge or inside public and private bathrooms, this is definitely a place where cameras should not be placed because once theseégés get out of hand, this can definitely be misused. Apart from that, I do not believe that cameras violate anybody's privacy provided that they are in the correct person's hands and not leaked out of the government's"

I mean, the musical performance can be highly affected by the existence of audience because they can dance and they can sometimes talk directly to the audiences and ask their opinions about the plot, about the protagonist in particular drama. But on the other hand, you can come up with the performance, musical performance, which plays very classical music in the theater. You can make some noise in that kind of performance. So it's very different from each by each performances, I mean, treats.

./data/1692751298358887-3.mp3," I believe it's a very good idea to create a computer club for elderly people. Why? You ask. It's because the elderly people have been so disconnected with the society lately. They feel they cannot connect or, you know, feel the same things that today's generations do. They have lost touch with their friends who have moved away and haven't been talking in over 15 to 20 or even more years. So if the city council wants to create a computer club for the elderly people, first of all, they would learn a lot about technology which they are eager to learn about. They are even more eager than the younger generation to learn new stuff, new tech of this generation. What do they use the computers for? They could use the computers for a lot of things. They could use it to plan their traveling or get connected to their friends who are living far away and haven't spoken in years on end. They could learn the new tech of this world and feel a little connected to the society. Would I like to work as an instructor? Definitely. I love working with elderly people a lot. They make me very appreciative of all the things that life has given me. Also, spending time with elderly people as I have personally experienced gives you a lot of wisdom as well. Hence, it really makes me happy to be able to spend time with the elderly people thus gaining the excessive wisdom of this world in order to walk through this rough life."

In one way, it does deprive the right to freedom of speech as people cannot express their opinion because they're scared it might hurt someone's feelings. Usually the government regulates social media in my country. A few of the social media platforms that are restricted in our country, one of them being TikTok, it was restricted for reasons like safety issues and for things which are set against the country. So to prevent people from getting hurt and to prevent spreading false information about different things and about the government, the government of India has banned a few media platforms."

I imagine it is in a community centre. So if the computer room was to be built and we had to choose between an older person or a first grader, I would probably say I would build it for the older people because they belong to a group of people who have had less access to computers, less exposure to computers and could benefit from having better access or having some computer lessons or having some help handy. This could help them develop their skills with using a computer, being able to access information and do everything else that is required."

This is a much more feasible option where you can just send them an email or drop them a text or give them a call. The drawbacks of this I would say is a lot of people tend to misunderstand what is communicated to them. Maybe because of a voice cut or network issues, they may not hear the message. is day and age and because it has more benefits than drawbacks.

./data/1685651809260295-3.mp3," If a child commits a crime, then yes, I would think that parents should punish it.

The stronger the crime, the worse the punishment, I would say."

./data/1685651809260553-3.mp3," Well, in my opinion, the parents should be punished if a child or a kid is committing a crime. Because as for me, the parents have a lot of responsibility on educating their child to not commit any crime. And also the environment that parents give the kid could cause that the kid is going to commit a crime so I think at some on some point the parent has some responsibility on this and also oh but another point is that I don't think they should be punished severely like the punishment should go on the kid mainly instead of the parent because the kid is it's not a big deal and that's something that everybody like everyone could do because of self-harm because they are angry about others so it doesn't has... oh I don't... yeah that's my opinion and when if you're a murderer then it's a really big deal I think the reason that could cause a kid to commit a murder is probably the family"

./data/1692530001326214-4.mp3," I think that homeschooling became really popular lately because of the convenience. It's extremely easy to keep your child around, but also to provide them with education because of the internet, because of the online courses, applications like Zoom and other communication systems. The main advantage, again, would be the convenience of providing information for the Internet to the children and generally the amount of information they can access through Internet. The main disadvantage would be, I guess, the surroundings of the student. Personally, I don't think I would educate my child at home.

And we should find a solution for this and provide people just the right information that is trusted and they will get benefit of reading this information. I think it's matter. We should not provide any information that could offend people because people are the users of social media platforms and we should provide them the best service that we can offer."
./data/1667330281849843-4.mp3," I think that this is an excellent question. It would be quite difficult for social media companies to actually verify that everything is true. I think that verify truth today has become a bit of a slippery slope term. It would be quite challenging for a company to have to take it upon themselves to define whether or not a piece of information is true. So whether or not I agree with this statement, I think the implementation of it would be far more challenging."

Don't be small head in a way, like become involved in each aspect along the R&D and the team. Try to learn about other activities around you and not focus only on what you need to do because it's a piece of puzzle. And the overall what we do here is a big story and you need to know the overall picture and not be focused only on the small thing that you do. So I think it will give you more motivation and more enthusiastic to be aware to what other people do and to work together with the team.

./data/1692748253740588-4.mp3," Well, the exams are an effective way to test the student's knowledge. Depending on the factual situation as well, I'd say for some cases, it is really significant to use exams to test the student's ability to find out the end to check the understanding whether they have learned something or not. However for some cases it is really difficult to measure their understanding because some of them appear to be in a very unique condition where you cannot just use a question based on the lesson to test their understanding. Probably it's to be better to make it more practical by probably using some sort of tools that can measure their probably brain or something. And when it comes to choosing the betterment of the exam, I think it depends as well. For some, I think it's going to be the written exam. Some might prefer the oral ones, but I prefer the oral ones because it takes less time to think and it is based on actual time to convey the message to the examiners.

And I think the parent and teachers can make the school more easier for children by they can do it by having more extra activities so that the children can learn in a better environment like having fun while learning when comparing to the virtual class they can only study at home and just have a discussion with their friends and it's not really that fun coming to school comparing to coming to school"
./data/1692748253740198-4.mp3," Our education is... depending on the topic of education, we have the public education or state-run or government education and the private education. The state education at school, public schools, is actually free. Students just enroll and they can go for free from the primary school up to the university actually. And currently in order to adapt to because the state school could not serve the needs of the parents, there are more private schools competing each other and challenging for the high quality of education. And now there are a lot of private schools opening up especially in the cities. And now it's starting to spread out at the outskirts and the other areas as well in the provinces. To me, I prefer more if I had to choose, I have to choose more private schools because there are much better standards than the state one. The state one is usually the teacher's quality is limited and we got limited facilities. Private school has much better facilities in terms of state of the art materials used in the classrooms and the campus. The extracurricular activities are also much better compared to the ones in the state schools. Although the tuition fee of the private schools is higher than in comparison to the one in the public school, it provides the students with more opportunity to get quality education through various extra-curricular activities as well as the in-class activity with the well-rounded experienced teachers, educators. There are more activities and more care. For example, if a student is absent, the parents will get a call or contact from the school informing their student absence.

When I study in university for my degree, yeah, almost all subject because of COVID-19 the country was yeah the students were not allowed to go outside so we study online yeah I think study online will be popular in the future because it will help the students that live far from the city to study in the city."

./data/1692748253740131-4.mp3," This is quite an interesting question. There are a lot of facets to address, but I guess I would say if I were the Minister of Education in the current country that I reside in, some of the changes that I would make would primarily be to expand the access of education for all children and to make quality education more affordable. There is high quality education available, but I find that that's limited to a certain segment of society. And really you want all people in a society to have equal access to quality education as that improves the society overall. And also make sure that you don't have any segments that are perpetually disenfranchised or unable to reach their full potential. I actually think that that would be my priority. I would like to lower school fees, I would like to lower the cost of books, I would like to lower the cost of uniforms. I think that people, regardless of their financial background or their family standing, should have access to the same high quality of education. While I think that it would be common sense or easy to make decisions such as that, you have to realize that there are different opinions and varied moneyed interests that are always going to be involved in any system, whether that be healthcare, transportation, or education. So you'll have to contend with different viewpoints and different interests. And I do think that that could make finding or achieving a resolution relatively difficult, even for some of the most common sense solutions. What makes me happy about the present situation in the country that I'm in is that each year there seems to be progress. We're not really where we need to be just yet, but each year you can see incrementally that we're getting closer to making education attainable for all people, regardless of their income."

So it's kind of easy way and we gotta know each other a lot. That's why I... that's the reason why I like them. And of course, being best friends, we have... we should have the same or similar attitude with each other. The same as us, we got the same attitude that we thought, we got the same goal, so it's really good. And if we got an argument in our friendship, we just got in talk. We don't have to feel guilty with each other. If we feel about what we do with each other. We just gotta talk in a group and find solutions and tell why we don't agree with that, why we don't like that. There are many things that I have done with them. We have hang out together, we have enjoyed food, we go on vacations together. We really spend almost all time of day at school, so we got many time together more than family.

I liked it because I like reading and reading poetry to understand about the about nature and to understand the words and the thoughts of the poets is really mesmerized me and my Literature is something that I am also pursuing at my higher studies. It's not very difficult, but it's very, very interesting and people should study that. I would recommend someone to study that because it also teaches us about many... It teaches us about English literature is someone a person who studies literature can know about can have know about feelings emotions and and culture as well."
./data/1692748253740741-4.mp3," flashback to my time in high school I always did my homework actually assigned by my teachers. From my perspective I do believe that homework is still potentially useful because it gives you a wide range of opportunity to revise your lessons to recall the understanding of the lesson and of course it's gonna be an outstanding platform for the teachers to catch up with the lessons and let students work at home with their parents. In my country, I've seen many teachers have given their kids plenty of homework as it is a traditional way and also the conservative way of learning and teaching. So that's what I've witnessed so far."

For example, you can go for marketing. People see accounting and finance is very less. They should go more and it is more important because it is the one who gives how much budget it should take and how much time it should take and people should more often take accounting finance because it is more responsible and it is the best advantage for the budgets of the firm"
./data/1692751298358446-4.mp3, For some classes are not that important and which is why I think it should be an option to attend classes or not because if people should not be forced on doing something which they don't like or appreciate so when we have that option it also gives the universities an opportunity to provide quality learning since they have those students who are genuinely interested and not who are just forcibly seated into the classrooms.
./data/1692748253740286-4.mp3," I would define an ECHO student as someone who is working hard, having very good learning attitude and also being here in class, also at home. I think there are things that ECHO students should do. For example, participate in class, helping each other, joining school campaigns or maybe projects, and also being a good person, I guess so. So when someone is a good person, that person will naturally do a good, and also perform well in class, I guess so. I think that's a not a medical student because I did not have a chance to help school or teach with other students such as doing the projects or maybe the comping because I had to earn the money so I did not have a lot of time in school."
./data/1692748253740486-4.mp3," I believe that in the world there is not just one source of knowledge, however there are actually a lot. And one of the best ways to obtain knowledge is through the real world experience. By working or doing things in the society, I believe that a lot of people would actually get to experience and understand what works look like so that they can actually learn more about the tasks or any activities that have been assigned. Because the knowledge written in the book also derives from the real experience itself, that means that the knowledge taken in the or done in the real world is much more valuable."

I used to take online before and it well, I didn't do well on those previous days. And well, but I can say that the subjects that most students always unusually study online, it is English. Well, English is language studying, so there are many things that people can keep that can keep everything in control. Well, so well, I hope that online can be still popular like today because it is so convenient. People can stay at home or be in multitask while studying and listening to teacher.

./data/1692751298358501-4.mp3," The main difference between public and private education in my country is here the public education quality is lower than the private educational quality. Though private education is expensive, but they dedicate a lot towards your child's future and the education there is far more better than that of a public institute or public educational college or school. So according to me, I think that private education is better. I will definitely send my children to private education system. Yes, in my country, private education is very popular."
./data/1692748253740653-4.mp3," Well, in Cambodia, I think that science subjects or the STEM subjects are very popular because right now we are moving into the digital era. So people are promoting more and more STEM subjects and there are also many competitions for young kids, for young students, teenagers to compete in the STEM area. And I think the reason that make a subject popular or less popular is according to the era we are into. So now we are living in the digital era. So of course the STEM subjects has become more and more white-known, more popular than the other subjects. And what makes a subject become less popular is that people ignore those subjects. they don't give value to that subject so it becomes less and less popular. I think it's like there's a trend when many people are into one particular subject and promote that subject more, many others feel like oh they should study that subject too in order to make the subject be"
./data/1692751298358510-4.mp3," I think exams are actually an effective way to test a student's knowledge and without exams I don't think anyone would even come to school or come to college or any other educational institute and I think both are better. Both exams written and also oral exams. Oral exams know, like present oneself and written exams helps in our written capabilities are urge to think right and assess, you know what the knowledge we already have and best way to prepare for exams is definitely studying every day and Firstly have like a interest in what you're actually reading and learning. So yeah, if they have you know a keen interest in exams and they learn, learn or read every day, then definitely we'll be really much you know ready to take on exams."
./data/1692748253740742-4.mp3," I agree that there's a phenomenon that lots of children are being educated at home. I think this is because of the COVID pandemic in which people have to be socially distancing from other people. And I think it could be because of the threat of bullying. Some people choose to school the children at home rather than mainstream education institutions. This brings benefits and times, for example, as a parent or teacher, you can ensure your children's safety, children don't have to travel. If parents work at home home they have the flexibility of arranging the class time and working at the same time. But the disadvantage is that students or kids don't learn social skills because there's only one student in the class which is themselves and they don't have interactions with other people."
./data/1692748253740788-4.mp3," Monitoring children's academic progress is very important. To me, I believe they should. Not they should, I think they must monitor their students, their children's academic progress. Because they send, like their parents send their kids to the good schools, Let's just say like ACE, AIS, BLT, Westline. Or some even send their kids to the even more better school like Southbridge, Northbridge, Footprint, ISPP. The reason is because they want their kids to have a better education, to have a good education for their future. So if they want it, they should look at their children's academic progress. And they need to have them at home. Look at their activities at home. Do they do their homework? Do they spare some time to review the lesson? Do they spare some time to read books? Or do they just play games all the time? So the parents must play an important role to monitor their children's academic progress. Maybe they can have a good contact with the teachers or academic officer at the school so that they can know the progress of their kids. To me, parents play a very important role in helping the kids to reach their academic goals."
./data/1692748253740912-4.mp3," Recently, the role of the teachers have changed a lot as a result of the technology. First of all, let us talk about how technology has helped the students. So in the past, most students relied a lot on the teacher. In case they had any questions, they would ask the teacher. But nowadays, with the advance of technology, for example, we have the internet where the students can get access to and do their own research. So somehow it could lighten the burden of the teacher. The students do not have to rely a lot on the teacher. The teacher also feels less pressure. In the past, they would have to do it manually, like marking the student's paper and stuff, but now maybe they can just assign a link of the exercise and maybe they can post it in a digital platform and let students complete it by themselves and it's just automatically marked by itself so this could have the teacher to reduce their paperwork. But I also believe that there could be also the drawback of the technology because we have robots and we believe that one day the robot will replace the teacher. So somehow the teacher could be in a dangerous position of losing their job in the future. But again, whether there's robot or not, I think we still need teacher because they could understand the feelings and what the student needs rather than a robot who simply do not have emotion to understand the people's needs."

We talk about how things should be done especially she does. She explains things in a very well mannered way and she tells me to do in this way so that I can get good marks. And not only in studies, she helps me in all way. I am very frank with her. she listens to me, she understands me, she tells me what to do and what not to do. So yeah, she is one of the best people I have met in college."
./data/1692751298358966-4.mp3," I definitely firmly believe that foreign language should be taught in elementary school. Children's brains are like worms for knowledge and I think this curiosity should be filled with the correct kind of information. Being bilingual or multilingual is almost common almost everywhere now and I think learning foreign languages in elementary school will not only help increase the person's educational knowledge, but rather be a creative exercise for their mind. Children are amazing creatures with wonderful minds and I think their minds should be filled with knowledge and information such as language which really works the brain. And as I've read from many researchers and studies, the first 10 to 15 years of a children's life are known as a learning stage for knowledge, especially languages. During that time, children can easily learn any language without having to put in extra effort. However, after 15, that becomes really difficult. Thus, I think elementary school students should definitely learn foreign languages in high school."
./data/1692751298358884-4.mp3," I think libraries won't go anywhere and they will still remain very relevant as the amount of knowledge a person can gain from the books in a library in a quiet environment and around people who are as motivated as you to learn about the world, about certain things is you can only find in a library and in a digital era you can't expect peace you can't expect the people to be around you and you can't get their insights after going out of the library obviously. So the libraries can continue to be relevant by installing computers maybe so that people can use these computers to learn from videos etc as in a peaceful environment and not only books"
./data/1692849194520981-4.mp3," It's quite hard to answer for this question. So there's kind of emerging changes in my country regarding the Ministry of Education in Korea. So I would like to change, if I were the minister, I would like to change to time of the whole for students because there are great burdens among Korean students. They even study until after 9pm and 10pm and I think it's a very insane situation. We are in the very insane situation. So what I'm gonna put my priority on is to give them freedom to choose what kind of subject they like to get in or choose to follow their own motivations to study. And I think this would be very difficult for me to realize, to make renovations and new education systems because traditionally parents eager and strive to give their children lots of knowledge and information as much as possible so that they can enter into a better college and get better jobs in the future. So I have to face very unseeable obstacles in the future. So, the things that make me happy about the present situation is that things are getting changed and people are considering to change the traditional ways of education"

And yeah, when I was second, when I was 18 at a high school, there was a good teacher to me who really worried about my future and who were really good at emphasizing the age of students. So yeah I remember her. She was such a good teacher and yeah actually she has a good knowledge of her subject and good work. I think students couldn't be allowed to choose their teacher because there are plenty of factors in it. I just worry about the parents choose the teacher for their sake, not for a student. And just student should follow the school's choice and respect the school's choice about teachers."

./data/1692751298358844-4.mp3," There are good teachers, yes you will find them but for that you have to attend classes regularly otherwise you won't know who is good for you. For me a good teacher is the one who can lead you by just looking at you. He will she will know anything about me without your saying. And the bad teachers I'll say are the ones who just want to steal your college just for the sake of teaching. I mean, you can just give them something from that. There is no exchange of ideas. They just spend too much time. They feel they are the bad teachers. And if I talk about my friend, the school teacher, he was a full-time little chapter of the design. He was so good, full of humor, such a approachable and helpful teacher. Everyone enjoyed his class very much. And in between all his class, he used to write some stories which helped getting more attention from the students. And he also taught us manners like when we used to think bad things about the class we all used to stoop for him. And when we used to say good morning and when we used to leave the class we used to again stoop for him and we used to say thank you sir. This was really I think a basic manner that we should know what he is doing and he taught us. I feel if you touch me on messaging, I can... without any hesitation, I can text you."
./data/1692751298358887-4.mp3," The benefits of eating or drinking in class is to maintain their concentration in food while the teacher is teaching and without permission they would just sneak food in and eat it during class which also causes a lot of distraction to the other students who are trying to focus. It also shows or reflects disrespect to the teacher who is teaching. That is, the student has been eating without permission, which shows that the student doesn't care about the respect for his teacher. Were you allowed to eat or drink in class? I wasn't allowed during my school time. However, there were some teachers, Although the school did not have a very prominent rule for it, some teachers did allow us to eat lest we ask permission for it. So if we did, they would let us eat for 5 to 10 minutes or drink water. Although drinking water did not require a lot of permission because drinking water is a necessity, but eating did require a permission level and we respected our teachers enough to ask them before drinking or eating food or water in the class during their teaching."
./data/1692837360255646-4.mp3," There are two sides to this. People who really want to pursue higher education, they should be allowed to go to school after 15. But people who want to pursue other fields in life which don't really need a lot of higher education can leave school after reaching the age of 15. The advantages of leaving school early, well, one of the advantages of leaving school early is that children can explore different areas of life. They get to know how life works, which makes it easier for them as an adult in order to live in the society and work. And one disadvantage of leaving school early is the fact that education, as it stopped in between, it kind of makes it difficult for people to take decisions because they're not really sure what's right and what's wrong. So it mostly depends on the person and how they really want to face life."
./data/1692837360255339-4.mp3, My first answer is no because primary school assessment and evaluation are not that important for certain subjects. Primary school students are meant to develop their personality through creativity. Because at the young age the brain starts develop so they have to instead of focusing on the assessment and evaluation they should be more active and more creative yes but at some subject there should be assessment and evaluation for example and consider subject max for that the assessment needs to be done and it helps us to identify figure out how far students are learned and which student need more help than other students this should take place via communication but subject like math should be done in through papers only.
./data/1685683425568880-4.mp3," I do think that parents should actively monitor the children's academic process. And the reason for saying that is that children are not that age to be autonomous enough, so they would benefit from some guidance in the areas where they're being challenged or where they're struggling and also they would need encouragement in areas where they are doing better because it could help improve their performance. My parents did not monitor my progress that much because they hadn't had the experience of studying in a school so they didn't know what to look for, they didn't know how to prioritize different aspects of my learning. And how did it affect the way I did my studies? Well I could probably have been more successful and my education could have been more effective. However I had some peers who had the privilege of having educated parents and I got guidance from them as well."

And another reason might be security concerns following these attacks on schools. There are several advantages and disadvantages. The advantages are having a one-to-one interaction with your teacher. But the disadvantage is the lack of social life from not having friends at school just like normal people and in my opinion I wouldn't educate my own child at home.
./data/1685651809260785-4.mp3," I think it's good for parents to have the password of their kids because for example in the internet social media is a very sometimes a very dark place for kids and I think if the parents have the passwords they will check and they will control what their kids are doing or seeing in the internet or social media. I think that the parents should limit the amount of time of what kids spend on the computer or smartphone because it's not healthy and it's not good for a kid that they spend all day in the computer or smartphone. It's not healthy for their, for example, their vision, their eyes, or just simply their mental health.

./data/1692687159035537-4.mp3," Exams. Exams is something that all children hear about. Not only children, we can also say that even the college going students are also very scared about exams. So is exams a correct way to test knowledge? I do not think so. But maybe, okay. It also depends upon on how you conduct the exams. Conducting exams just for the sake of it, a lot of portion that needs to be covered will be covered in a short time span and then the students will just go by heart the same information and come answer the exam. Here in this case, it's not the students' knowledge that is tested, it is their memory. Not everybody has great memory and that is not what needs to be tested here. test is people's knowledge. So instead of rather giving, rather making them write the same exact thing, a lot of different concepts needs to be tested. Even in oral exams, people need to be given the skills to talk in front of the class, to give out their own opinions out loud. A lot of debate competitions need to be conducted where students can come in front The best way to prepare for an exam is by understanding the lectures that has been taught in class and then reading through all the information that has been provided to you, understanding each and every concept thoroughly and not just by hurting everything."
./data/1692687159035961-4.mp3," Yes, art, music, dance, painting are as important as the education that we are learning. Since it's a hobby or a talent that we are producing, that is why it is something that's coming from within. So education, we are learning something, whereas the art, the dance, the music, it's something that we feel interested in. So a learning and an interest, it should be in a balanced form. So if I enjoy dancing, I will be taking part in college events as well as I will be focusing on academics. This creates a healthy environment for me to be in my university and this initiates a growth within myself as well as surrounding me."

Your reason of care, you know the pros that you're going to have with it. So you know that that isn't an object, it's a human. He has feelings, he has things, thoughts. He has to think the way he can of the way you are raising it. And it doesn't matter what type of crying he's committing. If he kills someone, you can see that raising the house is really good enough for them so we should take a really strange hand to the parents because they are not raising their kids in a good way"
./data/1692687159035217-4.mp3," More and more people they say take online classes. Maybe the reason is because they find it much easier than the face-to-face classes and then there are people who are socially anxious. So for those people it's better to take online classes. But for people who like to study among their friends, it is better for them to take a face-to-face classes both have their own reasons that why it should be good or why it should be bad and then According to me, I think yes, there will be more number of people studying online in the future because The generation is changing the technology is increasing as well. According to me in my opinion face-to-face education is more effective as it is more challenging and more refreshing. Yeah."

I love reading books I love the I love that I can go to a good library and just switch off and actually like listen to my thoughts and Learn a lot of new stuff that I didn't know before So the future of libraries in the digital era if I'm being honest, it's not looking good because There's a lot of Things that are coming up. You can get a Kindle, which is basically you can get any books online. So there is like definitely no purpose for a library to be there. That's what people think. And libraries don't get much business because of this, which is why they close down. Changing roles of academic libraries in the digital age. I love the library in my college. I always go there. The changing roles is now they have also adapted a lot of changes like they have brought when you enter, you have to scan your ID and then there's all the books are kept in a digital format. So it's easier to find these books. So I think those things are good because digital hand-in-hand with actual physical libraries, I think they can both go hand-in-hand. The internet can't replace, obviously the interaction because the librarians and the people in libraries, they help with what you're like in order to, if you tell them what you want, they'll help you to go to certain sections where you can actually find it. And the library or some ways that the library can remain relevant is I think that they should adapt certain digital approaches to like I said, scanning books and then keeping them in a digital format so that it's easier to find them and then also for students to be able to find the books digitally. Yeah, thank you."
./data/1692687159035996-4.mp3," Yeah, it has been noticed in recent times that universities have increased their offering of online courses. There are many advantages to this. Firstly, it offers students and interested learners a chance to obtain a certificate in learning from these courses. They can avail them from universities that offer these courses to them. And there are courses that are suited to online learning. I would say maybe learning how to use Microsoft Excel or Word in an advanced manner could be something, could be a course that could be offered online. It has, and also one more course that what we say is coding. I think you can learn coding quite well if you do it online. You don't really need an often environment to learn coding. And there are disadvantages as well to online courses because it's not really available to everyone, is it? Because there could be countries that are developing and maybe people just don't have the facilities to avail these online courses. They may still prefer the old way of learning these courses in an offline environment. And yes, about another advantage of these online courses is it can be made available to all. So there is no real discrimination as to who can take these courses."

Because that way you can meet more people of different genders and even gain a partner of some sort like a boyfriend or a girlfriend. The bad parts of this would be that sometimes girls and boys can do some very bad stuff that is not appropriate for school and that would be one that would be punishable.

Yeah, and another measure that could help is probably put a lot of trash cans on the street and also anonymizing the importance of recycling and everything.

There are some areas that are really not suited for inhabitants. Rather that is the coastline, which is subject to erosion and vicious storms, or if we're talking about building settlements on steep embankments in countries that have prolific rainy seasons, which often end in mudslides. So I think we may be able to manage our settlements and our habitations a bit better. And I also think that there is some significant work we can do with stopping climate change.

For example, the invention and also the widespread of the social media actually allowed people to communicate with each other through online and without having to meet in person.

./data/1692748253740653-5.mp3," Now I would like to talk about if it's okay to break rules if you disobey the rule. I think there are also a number of rules that they are fine to break. For example, like for girls to wear lipstick at school. When I was in high school or when I was young, students were not able to wear lipstick. So I think it's fine to have some slightly makeup on. Whether you wear, you know, like at my school, when I was young student, must wear sneakers to school. However, I think it's fine if we don't have to wear sneakers because we don't have money to buy those sneakers, we can just wear any other shoe like sandals or flip flop. However, there are some rules that it's not okay to break. For example, like if you kill someone, if you do something that harm others, those kind of things are never okay to break.

There are many benefits of studying foreign languages. You can settle in that foreign country. You can communicate with different people. You are opening yourself to widen horizons, not just being existing in your own country and being satisfied by it, but actually existing the world, the whole world that's out there.

./data/1692748253740788-5.mp3," When talking about recycling, not many people know what it is. I mean they know but they don't really know the importance because Cambodia, let's say the old people, elderly people, they didn't get good education when they were young because of the poor regime and because of the war. And now teachers start to provide good education to the young generation, so the kids learn more about recycling as well. However, there is no encouragement from the government. The government does not play any role in helping them to know the importance of recycling. What we look at nowadays, people start to recycle because they know some Vietnamese people walking along the street with a cart to buy all recyclable materials like they say, ảchái, ảch้. So when they walk along the street, they will buy used papers, used cans, bottles, yeah, so that they can sell to ศไจ้ and they bring them to Vietnam to make them into a new material from the recyclable materials. So I think Cambodian people know about recycle from Vietnamese ศไจ้, yeah, ศไจ้ dealer walking along the street with a cart to collect to buy the used material from people all over Cambodia. So thank you so much to Vietnamese people who started recycling ideas in Cambodia."

Maybe let us talk about safety on the road. In Cambodia, people are forced to strictly abide by the rules. For example, they have to wear helmet all the time regardless whether they are using motorbikes or bikes, they have to wear helmet. In case that they do not wear it, they will receive punishment, for example, maybe fine of $10 or $20 if they are found to not wear the helmet. So actually the rule is good. It's kind of the people kind of feel forceful but again this is just for our own safety so regardless of that I think they have the right to do so."

./data/1692751298358966-5.mp3," I think the issue of environmental crisis is not an issue where you can point fingers to each other and say that so and so person is responsible for a particular crisis. Environmental crisis is a wide topic. Some or the other person is some or the other in some of some or the other way responsible for some sort of environmental crisis sort of almost sort of like a butterfly effect. But I do believe that while the population does think that necessarily might contribute to environmental crisis, the bigger burden here is on the major corporations that do not follow the rules and regulations required. I mean, I as a person might leave my lights on in a room for one or two hours, and that might contribute to the environment in some or the other way. However, it is definitely not comparable to the vast amount of industrial exploitation of the environment going on. So I think this is a matter in which we should not point fingers to each other but rather take steps equally and bigger people should take bigger steps. So the major corporations should take bigger steps to overcome this particular environmental crisis."

And I think that to overcome this biological crisis, we have to consider the way of sustainable method to produce energy. And maybe we should take into account to make some electronic cars as people trying to do at the moment. And I think that the rising awareness of the crisis of the environment also one factor we should consider highly because more and more people I think as far as I'm concerned don't care throwing their you know trashes just on the streets and they don't try to do actually realize and make some progress into their own actions. So I think that we should, I mean, the governments should, you know, teach the citizens, teach the people to make high awareness about the situations.

./data/1692687159035537-5.mp3," Teenagers do not get a lot of sleep nowadays. This is because they tend to spend most of their hours in college or school studying and the remaining hours they tend to spend a lot of it on technology gadgets, mobile phones, laptops, TV or whatsoever. It is important for them to get quality of sleep because in order to lead a happy and a healthy life, they need to get enough amount of sleep. Without sleep, they won't be active enough or fit enough the next day to attend lectures, which will affect their studies itself. So in order for teenagers to make sure they get enough sleep, firstly they should reduce their screen timing and focus more on calming themselves before going to sleep so that they tend to fall asleep much faster than being on their phones watching movies because of which they don't get sleep. There have been a lot of cases where children don't sleep enough and there are a lot of health problems that also occur because of this issue.
